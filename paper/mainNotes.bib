@FOOTNOTE{Note1,key="Note1",note=" This discrepancy seems to be, at least in part, an issue of data collection. They tried to find papers that had ``[a]t least one of the keywords ... present in title, keywords or abstract,'' but their Figure 1 shows virtually no papers until 2014. Even after, the number seems to be, at most, a couple dozen per year until past 2016. They also explain their difficulty in navigating Google Scholar's opaque algorithm, an increasingly common problem in computational studies~\cite {poudelCuratedRealitiesIntersection2025}. As discussed in Section~\ref {limitations}, this paper too suffers from a similar limitation, though from a different data source. "}
