	url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15677v1},
	abstract = {Competition among news sources may encourage some sources to share fake news and misinformation to influence the public. While sharing misinformation may lead to a short-term gain in audience engagement, it may damage the reputation of these sources, resulting in a loss of audience. To understand the rationale behind sharing misinformation, we model the competition as a zero-sum sequential game, where each news source influences individuals based on its credibility-how trustworthy the public perceives it-and the individual's opinion and susceptibility. In this game, news sources can decide whether to share factual information to enhance their credibility or disseminate misinformation for greater immediate attention at the cost of losing credibility. We employ the quantal response equilibrium concept, which accounts for the bounded rationality of human decision-making, allowing for imperfect or probabilistic choices. Our analysis shows that the resulting equilibria for this game reproduce the credibility-bias distribution observed in real-world news sources, with hyper-partisan sources more likely to spread misinformation than centrist ones. It further illustrates that disseminating misinformation can polarize the public. Notably, our model reveals that when one player increases misinformation dissemination, the other player is likely to follow, exacerbating the spread of misinformation. We conclude by discussing potential strategies to mitigate the spread of fake news and promote a more factual and reliable information landscape.},

The resulting sharp increase in scholarly publications bears the risk of lack of overview, fragmentation across disciplines, and ultimately a lack of research cumulativity. To counteract these risks, we have performed a systematic research review of 1261 journal articles published between 2010 and 2021. Results show the field is mostly data-driven, frequently investigating the prevalence, dissemination, detection or characteristics of misinformation, disinformation, and fake news. There further are clear foci concerning contributing disciplines, methodologies, and data usage. Building on our results, we identify several research gaps and suggest avenues for future research.},

The concerns about unethical use of algorithms, unintended consequences of metrics, as well as the warning about statistical and mathematical malpractices are all part of a general malaise, symptoms of our tight addiction to quantification. What problems are shared by all these instances of quantification? After reviewing existing concerns about different domains, the present perspective article illustrates the need and the urgency for an encompassing ethics of quantification. The difficulties to discipline the existing regime of numerification are addressed; obstacles and lock-ins are identified. Finally, indications for policies for different actors are suggested.{\textless}/jats:p{\textgreater}},

To understand a thwarted Turkish coup, an anti– Wall Street encampment, and a packed Tahrir Square, we must first comprehend the power and the weaknesses of using new technologies to mobilize large numbers of people. An incisive observer, writer, and participant in today’s social movements, Zeynep Tufekci explains in this accessible and compelling book the nuanced trajectories of modern protests— how they form, how they operate differently from past protests, and why they have difficulty persisting in their long-term quests for change. Tufekci speaks from direct experience, combining on-the-ground interviews with insightful analysis. She describes how the internet helped the Zapatista uprisings in Mexico, the necessity of remote Twitter users to organize medical supplies during Arab Spring, the refusal to use bullhorns in the Occupy Movement that started in New York, and the empowering effect of tear gas in Istanbul’s Gezi Park. These details from life inside social movements complete a moving investigation of authority, technology, and culture— and offer essential insights into the future of governance.},

	abstract = {Data science is not simply a method but an organising idea. Commitment to the new paradigm overrides concerns caused by collateral damage, and only a counterculture can constitute an effective critique. Understanding data science requires an appreciation of what algorithms actually do; in particular, how machine learning learns. The resulting ‘insight through opacity’ drives the observable problems of algorithmic discrimination and the evasion of due process. But attempts to stem the tide have not grasped the nature of data science as both metaphysical and machinic. Data science strongly echoes the neoplatonism that informed the early science of Copernicus and Galileo. It appears to reveal a hidden mathematical order in the world that is superior to our direct experience. The new symmetry of these orderings is more compelling than the actual results. Data science does not only make possible a new way of knowing but acts directly on it; by converting predictions to pre-emptions, it becomes a machinic metaphysics. The people enrolled in this apparatus risk an abstraction of accountability and the production of ‘thoughtlessness’. Susceptibility to data science can be contested through critiques of science, especially standpoint theory, which opposes the ‘view from nowhere’ without abandoning the empirical methods. But a counterculture of data science must be material as well as discursive. Karen Barad’s idea of agential realism can reconfigure data science to produce both non-dualistic philosophy and participatory agency. An example of relevant praxis points to the real possibility of ‘machine learning for the people’.},

Abnormal speech in someone showing early signs of psychosis can help doctors diagnose schizophrenia and its ‘negative’ symptoms. Natália Mota from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil, and colleagues asked 21 people undergoing first clinical contact for recent-onset psychosis and 21 healthy controls to recall a dream or recent memory. They then analyzed the structure of the participants’ verbal reports using a mathematical technique. The patients were followed up during 6 months to establish a more formal diagnosis. The researchers found that those later diagnosed with schizophrenia exhibited more disorganized speech (almost random in structure) at the initial doctor’s visit than those later diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Less connected speech among people with schizophrenia was also indicative of more severe negative symptoms such as blunted emotions and lack of motivation.},

Occasionally, after such interviews, children are confronted with misinformation regarding their experiences. The question that arises is whether their earlier interviews may protect them from reporting misinformation. The goal of the present experiment was to assess whether empirically based interviewing by means of the National Institute for Child Health and Development (NICHD) Protocol would affect the reporting of misinformation in children. Children were involved in an interactive event (i.e., science demonstration). Following this, three experimental groups were created: one group was interviewed using the NICHD Protocol, one group had to freely recall what they experienced, and one group was not asked to retrieve any memories about the event. Next, all children received misinformation concerning the event and were then subjected to a final memory test. We found that children’s recall during the NICHD interview protected children against the incorporation of misinformation in their accounts of the event. This effect was absent in the other two conditions. The current experiment suggests that evidence-based investigative interviewing can inoculate children’s memory against the corrupting impact of misinformation.},

	abstract = {Objective
To compare and summarize the literature regarding infodemics and health misinformation, and to identify challenges and opportunities for addressing the issues of infodemics.

Methods
We searched MEDLINE®, Embase®, Cochrane Library of Systematic Reviews, Scopus and Epistemonikos on 6 May 2022 for systematic reviews analysing infodemics, misinformation, disinformation and fake news related to health. We grouped studies based on similarity and retrieved evidence on challenges and opportunities. We used the AMSTAR 2 approach to assess the reviews’ methodological quality. To evaluate the quality of the evidence, we used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation guidelines.

Findings
Our search identified 31 systematic reviews, of which 17 were published. The proportion of health-related misinformation on social media ranged from 0.2\% to 28.8\%. Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Instagram are critical in disseminating the rapid and far-reaching information. The most negative consequences of health misinformation are the increase of misleading or incorrect interpretations of available evidence, impact on mental health, misallocation of health resources and an increase in vaccination hesitancy. The increase of unreliable health information delays care provision and increases the occurrence of hateful and divisive rhetoric. Social media could also be a useful tool to combat misinformation during crises. Included reviews highlight the poor quality of published studies during health crises.

Conclusion
Available evidence suggests that infodemics during health emergencies have an adverse effect on society. Multisectoral actions to counteract infodemics and health misinformation are needed, including developing legal policies, creating and promoting awareness campaigns, improving health-related content in mass media and increasing people’s digital and health literacy.},

	abstract = {Online social networks (OSNs) are rapidly growing and have become a huge source of all kinds of global and local news for millions of users. However, OSNs are a double-edged sword. Although the great advantages they offer such as unlimited easy communication and instant news and information, they can also have many disadvantages and issues. One of their major challenging issues is the spread of fake news. Fake news identification is still a complex unresolved issue. Furthermore, fake news detection on OSNs presents unique characteristics and challenges that make finding a solution anything but trivial. On the other hand, artificial intelligence (AI) approaches are still incapable of overcoming this challenging problem. To make matters worse, AI techniques such as machine learning and deep learning are leveraged to deceive people by creating and disseminating fake content. Consequently, automatic fake news detection remains a huge challenge, primarily because the content is designed in a way to closely resemble the truth, and it is often hard to determine its veracity by AI alone without additional information from third parties. This work aims to provide a comprehensive and systematic review of fake news research as well as a fundamental review of existing approaches used to detect and prevent fake news from spreading via OSNs. We present the research problem and the existing challenges, discuss the state of the art in existing approaches for fake news detection, and point out the future research directions in tackling the challenges.},

Fake facts in their various forms have long been present in American life, particularly in its politics, public discourse, and business activities – going back to the time when the country was formed. This book explores the long tradition of fake facts, in their various guises, in American history. It is one of the first historical studies to place the long history of lies and misrepresentation squarely in the middle of American political, business, and science policy rhetoric. In Fake News Nation, James Cortada and William Aspray present a series of case studies that describe how lies and fake facts were used over the past two centuries in important instances in American history. Cortada and Aspray give readers a perspective on fake facts as they appear today and as they are likely to appear in the future.},

	abstract = {After the 2016 US presidential elections, the term ‘fake news’ became synonymous with disinformation and a catch-all term for the problems that social networks were bringing to communication. Four years later, there are dozens of empirical studies that have attempted to describe and analyse an issue that, despite still being in the process of definition, has been identified as one of the key COVID-19 cyberthreats by Interpol, is considered a threat to democracy by many states and supranational institutions and, as a consequence, is subject to regulation or even criminalization. These legislative and criminal policy interventions form part of the first stage in the construction of a moral panic that may lead to the restriction of freedom of expression and information. By analysing empirical research that attempts to measure the extent of the issue and its impact, the present article aims to provide critical reflection on the process of constructing fake news as a threat. Via a systematic review of the literature, we observe, firstly, that the concept of fake news used in empirical research is limited and should be refocused because it has not been constructed according to scientific criteria and can fail to include relevant elements and actors, such as governments and traditional media. Secondly, the article analyses what is known scientifically about the extent, consumption and impact of fake news and argues that it is problematic to establish causal relationships between the issue and the effects it has been said to produce. This conclusion requires us to conduct further research and to reconsider the position of fake news as a threat as well as the resulting regulation and criminalization.},

Later, the memory may emerge into consciousness. Repression is one of the foundation stones on which the structure of psychoanalysis rests. Recently there has been a rise in reported memories of childhood sexual abuse that were allegedly repressed for many years. With recent changes in legislation, people with recently unearthed memories are suing alleged perpetrators for events that happened 20, 30, even 40 or more years earlier. These new developments give rise to a number of questions: (1) How common is it for memories of child abuse to be repressed? (2) How are jurors and judges likely to react to these repressed memory claims? (3) When the memories surface, what are they like? and (4) How authentic are the memories?

While Americans were concerned about secret cults of devil worshipers, therapists, consultants, and media personalities were hard at work to profit from those anxieties. Grounded in Foucault and Virilio, trauma studies has epitomized the technologies of social control via popular psychology literature to create a traumatized subject, who is bound by their genealogy, medicalized, politicized, and transformed into a product in the trauma-informed market of the 21st century.},

A recent line of research has demonstrated that when people are exposed to fake news they can form false memories for the events depicted in the news stories. We conducted a meta-analysis to obtain an estimate of the average rate of false memories elicited by fake news. Thirteen articles were included in the final analysis, revealing that nearly 40\% and 60\% of the participants reported at least one false memory and belief (respectively) after fake news exposure, while each participant remembered or believed 22\% of the total number of fake news presented. Individual differences may affect the rate of false memory formation following exposure to false memories. We therefore examined moderating effects of individual difference variables assessed in the included studies. Participants with better analytical reasoning skills and a high level of interest in the news topic were least likely to report false memories for fake news, with level of interest being also a facilitating factor in remembering true news. No effect was detected for cognitive ability and objective knowledge. Our results provide insightful and practical information in the context of world-wide misinformation dissemination and its impact on people's beliefs and memories.},

	abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms by which information and misinformation spread through groups of individual actors is essential to the prediction of phenomena ranging from coordinated group behaviors to misinformation epidemics. Transmission of information through groups depends on the rules that individuals use to transform the perceived actions of others into their own behaviors. Because it is often not possible to directly infer decision-making strategies in situ, most studies of behavioral spread assume that individuals make decisions by pooling or averaging the actions or behavioral states of neighbors. However, whether individuals may instead adopt more sophisticated strategies that exploit socially transmitted information, while remaining robust to misinformation, is unknown. Here, we study the relationship between individual decision-making and misinformation spread in groups of wild coral reef fish, where misinformation occurs in the form of false alarms that can spread contagiously through groups. Using automated visual field reconstruction of wild animals, we infer the precise sequences of socially transmitted visual stimuli perceived by individuals during decision-making. Our analysis reveals a feature of decision-making essential for controlling misinformation spread: dynamic adjustments in sensitivity to socially transmitted cues. This form of dynamic gain control can be achieved by a simple and biologically widespread decision-making circuit, and it renders individual behavior robust to natural fluctuations in misinformation exposure.},

	abstract = {Public trust in institutions is a key prerequisite for effective crisis management. However, the rise of populism and misinformation in recent years made it increasingly difficult to maintain institutional trust. Despite this recognition, we still lack a systematic understanding of how exposure to misinformation and populist political orientation affect people’s trust in institutions. This paper fills this gap by adopting an original approach to trust, focusing on prospective trust rather than trust in the present, and by comparing four countries led by populist leaders during the pandemic – Brazil, Poland, Serbia, and the United States. The comparative design allows us to consider not only the role of individual-level factors (populist attitudes and misinformation exposure) but also the role of different approaches to the COVID-19 pandemic adopted in the four countries. The study utilizes data from a cross-sectional survey, carried out between November and December 2022 (N = 5000). Our findings show that populist attitudes are the most significant predictor of distrust in political institutions in all four countries. Believing in false information related to COVID-19, on the other hand, has a stronger impact on distrust in expert institutions – public health authorities, scientists, and medical professionals. The data also highlight the importance of local context and different approaches to handling the pandemic in the dynamics of trust. In Poland and Serbia, populist voters have more trust in both healthcare authorities as well as in political institutions; however, in Brazil and the United States, populist voters were more likely to distrust expert institutions.},

In the Jane Doe case that began in 1997, Loftus and Melvin J. Guyer revealed serious concerns about the background and validity of the initial research. She has also served on the executive council of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry and was a keynote speaker at the British Psychological Society's 2011 annual conference. As well as her scientific work, Loftus has provided expert testimony or consultation for lawyers in over 300 court cases, including for the legal teams of Ghislaine Maxwell, Harvey Weinstein, Ted Bundy, O.

On a retest one week later, those subjects who received the verb smashed were more likely to say “yes” to the question, “Did you see any broken glass?”, even though broken glass was not present in the film.

We need new approaches to combat misinformation and prevent its potential far-reaching consequences in real-world contexts with major implications for societal issues such as legal justice, community health, and politics. Here we briefly review the misinformation effect and call for an expansion of the small body of literature on means to prevent and correct misinformation.

Older adults are especially susceptible -- they shared the most fake news during the 2016 US election. The most intuitive explanation for this pattern blames cognitive deficits. While older adults forget where they learned information, fluency remains intact and decades of accumulated knowledge helps them evaluate claims. Thus, cognitive declines cannot fully explain older adults' engagement with fake news. Late adulthood also involves social changes, including general trust, difficulty detecting lies, and less emphasis on accuracy when communicating. In addition, older adults are relative newcomers to social media, who may struggle to spot sponsored content or manipulated images. In a post-truth world, interventions should consider older adults' shifting social goals and gaps in their digital literacy.},

Many online platforms have taken steps to address this by adding a warning label to articles identified as false, but past research has shown mixed evidence for the effectiveness of such labels, and many prior studies have looked only at either short-term impacts or non-political information. This study tested three versions of fake news labels with 541 online participants in a two-wave study. A warning that came before a false headline was initially very effective in both discouraging belief in false headlines generally and eliminating a partisan congruency effect (the tendency to believe politically congenial information more readily than politically uncongenial information). In the follow-up survey two weeks later, however, we found both high levels of belief in the articles and the re-emergence of a partisan congruency effect in all warning conditions, even though participants had known just two weeks ago the items were false. The new pre-warning before the headline showed some small improvements over other types, but did not stop people from believing the article once seen again without a warning. This finding suggests that warnings do have an important immediate impact and may work well in the short term, though the durability of that protection is limited.},

Participants (N = 3,140) viewed six news stories concerning campaign events-two fabricated and four authentic. Almost half of the sample reported a false memory for at least one fabricated event, with more than one third of participants reporting a specific memory of the event. "Yes" voters (those in favor of legalizing abortion) were more likely than "no" voters to "remember" a fabricated scandal regarding the campaign to vote "no," and "no" voters were more likely than "yes" voters to "remember" a fabricated scandal regarding the campaign to vote "yes." This difference was particularly strong for voters of low cognitive ability. A subsequent warning about possible misinformation slightly reduced rates of false memories but did not eliminate these effects. This study suggests that voters in a real-world political campaign are most susceptible to forming false memories for fake news that aligns with their beliefs, in particular if they have low cognitive ability.},

The problem of systematic misinformation is attacked by opting for a bonus based not on profit achieved but rather, on an average of the profit achieved and the planned profit. Thus there is an incentive to divulge more information, but the awareness (on the part of managers) that higher performance will affect bonus norms is not removed. Also, because it is profits that determine bonuses, a firm now has an incentive to reduce costs - if it keeps its output constant (and thus the output norm constant) it can still get a higher bonus by reducing costs and hence increasing profits. But, clearly, this too fails; we have merely added another dimension to the conflict. Managers will soon recognize that not only output norms but also profitability norms are sensitive to achieved output and profit. Thus the Liberman reforms, though implicitly recognizing the problems involved, do not introduce the structural changes needed to remove the conflict. © 1970 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

  abstract = {Background: Surveys are popular methods to measure public perceptions in emergencies but can be costly and time consuming. We suggest and evaluate a complementary "infoveillance" approach using Twitter during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Our study aimed to: 1) monitor the use of the terms "H1N1" versus "swine flu" over time; 2) conduct a content analysis of "tweets"; and 3) validate Twitter as a real-time content, sentiment, and public attention trend-tracking tool. Methodology/Principal Findings: Between May 1 and December 31, 2009, we archived over 2 million Twitter posts containing keywords "swine flu," "swineflu," and/or "H1N1." using Infovigil, an infoveillance system. Tweets using "H1N1" increased from 8.8\% to 40.5\% (R2 =.788; p{$<$}.001), indicating a gradual adoption of World Health Organizationrecommended terminology. 5,395 tweets were randomly selected from 9 days, 4 weeks apart and coded using a tri-axial coding scheme. To track tweet content and to test the feasibility of automated coding, we created database queries for keywords and correlated these results with manual coding. Content analysis indicated resource-related posts were most commonly shared (52.6\%). 4.5\% of cases were identified as misinformation. News websites were the most popular sources (23.2\%), while government and health agencies were linked only 1.5\% of the time. 7/10 automated queries correlated with manual coding. Several Twitter activity peaks coincided with major news stories. Our results correlated well with H1N1 incidence data. Conclusions: This study illustrates the potential of using social media to conduct "infodemiology" studies for public health. 2009 H1N1-related tweets were primarily used to disseminate information from credible sources, but were also a source of opinions and experiences. Tweets can be used for real-time content analysis and knowledge translation research, allowing health authorities to respond to public concerns. \copyright{} 2010 Chew et al.},

Yet, while learning about the world through social ties can confer many benefits, these connections can also serve as conduits for misinformation. Studies of misinformation in human social systems are rapidly proliferating, yet our understanding of the biological origins of misinformation remains surprisingly limited. In this review, we survey examples of socially transmitted misinformation across biological systems. Our central findings are (i) that the transmission and use of misinformation is widespread in biological systems spanning levels of organization, and (ii) that the production and transmission of misinformation is probably an inevitable property that inherits from fundamental constraints on biological communication systems, rather than a pathology that lies apart from the normal functioning of such systems. In this light, we argue that there is a need for a more integrated theoretical and empirical science of misinformation in biology. We end by highlighting four emerging questions about misinformation and its role in driving ecological and evolutionary dynamics that this new field of inquiry should address.},

  abstract = {Digital media platforms have transformed how societies encounter, evaluate, and act upon information. Yet the infrastructures that govern this visibility, eg, search engines and social media feeds, operate through algorithmic systems that selectively surface, rank, and frame content. This dissertation investigates how those systems mediate public knowledge in the post-API era, when direct access to platform data has been sharply restricted. It asks two linked questions: (1) Can search engines be treated as observational proxies for social media data? and (2) How do their ranking and framing choices influence user understanding and behavior? The theoretical framework joins two literatures: algorithmic gatekeeping, which treats ranking and recommendation as infrastructures of visibility, and framing theory, which explains how linguistic and structural cues shape cognition. Together they suggest that digital intermediaries do not merely transmit information, they construct the epistemic environment in which facts, controversies, and communities become perceptible. The dissertation therefore conceptualizes search engines as dual mediators: instruments that shape both the empirical data available to researchers and the interpretive frames available to users. This thesis argues that search engines systematically distort the informational landscape. Their curation amplifies popular and positively valenced content while suppressing the controversial, explicit, conspiratorial, and politically charged; moreover, the framing of what is shown guides user attention and steers subsequent searches. These two forms of mediation—structural and cognitive—jointly compromise the reliability of search engines as research proxies and magnify their power as shapers of public discourse. Empirical analyses across four studies substantiate this claim. Large-scale comparisons between Google's Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs) and ground-truth datasets from Reddit and Twitter/X reveal extensive topical and sentiment gaps: SERPs overrepresent high-engagement and neutral material while omitting entire communities and issue clusters. A second line of work shows that Google's ranking of hashtags and subreddits privileges visible, low-toxicity spaces and filters out sexual, conspiratorial, and crypto-related content, confirming the gatekeeping hypothesis. Cross-engine audits of Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo demonstrate systematic differences in ideological bias and factuality, with Google favoring left-leaning, higher-factuality sources and Bing favoring right-leaning ones. Finally, controlled behavioral experiments establish that brief exposure to framed headlines measurably redirects follow-up queries: conflict and strategy frames induce polarized search trajectories, while thematic frames promote analytic engagement. Taken together, these findings portray search engines as epistemic infrastructures whose curation and framing co-produce the boundaries of what can be known. By mapping both the methodological distortion and the behavioral consequence of algorithmic mediation, this dissertation contributes to computational social science, information retrieval, and political communication, and argues for treating search transparency not merely as a technical issue but as a condition of democratic knowledge.},

Williams stresses the importance of technology in shaping the cultural form of television, while always resisting the determinism of McLuhan's dictum that 'the medium is the message'. If the medium really is the message, Williams asks, what is left for us to do or say? Williams argues that, on the contrary, we as viewers have the power to disturb, disrupt and to distract the otherwise cold logic of history and technology - not just because television is part of the fabric of our daily lives, but because new technologies continue to offer opportunities, momentarily outside the sway of transnational corporations or the grasp of media moguls, for new forms of self and political expression.},

Based on a classification of news outlets curated by www.opensources.co, we find that 25\% of these tweets spread either fake or extremely biased news. We characterize the networks of information flow to find the most influential spreaders of fake and traditional news and use causal modeling to uncover how fake news influenced the presidential election. We find that, while top influencers spreading traditional center and left leaning news largely influence the activity of Clinton supporters, this causality is reversed for the fake news: the activity of Trump supporters influences the dynamics of the top fake news spreaders.},

  abstract = {Online attention is an increasingly valuable resource in the digital age, with extraordinary events such as the COVID-19 pandemic fuelling fierce competition around it. As misinformation pervades online platforms, users seek credible sources, while news outlets compete to attract and retain their attention. Here we measure the co-evolution of online “engagement” with (mis)information and its “visibility”, where engagement corresponds to user interactions on social media, and visibility to fluctuations in user follower counts. Using a scalable temporal network modelling framework applied to over 100 million COVID-related retweets spanning 3 years, we find that highly engaged sources experience sharp spikes in follower growth during major events (e.g., vaccine rollouts, epidemic severity), whereas sources with more questionable credibility tend to sustain faster growth outside of these periods. Our framework lends itself to studying other large-scale events where online attention is at stake, such as climate and political debates.},

  abstract = {Americans are under assault by a fierce epidemic of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, of their own doing. Lowered death rates from heart disease and reduced rates of smoking are seriously threatened by the inexorable rise in overweight and obesity. Latest data indicate that 32\% of children are overweight or obese, and fewer than 17\% exercise sufficiently. Over 68\% of adults are overweight, 35\% are obese, nearly 40\% fulfill criteria for the metabolic syndrome, 8-13\% have diabetes, 34\% have hypertension, 36\% have prehypertension, 29\% have prediabetes, 15\% of the population with either diabetes, hypertension, or dyslipidemia are undiagnosed, 59\% engage in no vigorous activity, and fewer than 5\% of the US population qualifies for the American Heart Association (AHA) definition of ideal cardiovascular health. Health, nutrition, and exercise illiteracy is prevalent, while misinformation and unrealistic expectations are the norm. Half of American adults have at least one cardiovascular risk factor. Up to 65\% do not have their conventional risk biomarkers under control. Of those patients with multiple risk factors, fewer than 10\% have all of them adequately controlled. Even when patients are treated according to evidence-based protocols, about 70\% of cardiac events remain unaddressed. Undertreatment is also common. Poor patient adherence, probably well below 50\%, adds further difficulty in reducing cardiovascular risk. Available data indicate that only a modest fraction of the total cardiovascular risk burden in the population is actually now being eliminated. A fresh view of these issues, a change in current philosophy, leading to new and different, multimechanistic methods of prevention may be needed. Adherence to published guidelines will improve substantially outcomes in both primary and secondary prevention. Primordial prevention, which does not allow risk values to appear in a population, affords more complete protection than subsequent partial reversal of elevated risk factors or biomarkers. Current evidence supports recent calls for massive educational programs supporting primordial prevention, individual responsibility and pride in achieving population-wide ideal cardiovascular health through lifestyle modification. Environmental and social changes will be necessary, along with major supportive adjustments in the food industry and the assistance of the media. Cooperation is critical to the success of such an initiative.},

  abstract = {Why is science so credible? Usual answers center on scientists' objective methods or their powerful instruments. In his new book, Thomas Gieryn argues that a better explanation for the cultural authority of science lies downstream, when scientific claims leave laboratories and enter courtrooms, boardrooms, and living rooms. On such occasions, we use "maps" to decide who to believe---cultural maps demarcating "science" from pseudoscience, ideology, faith, or nonsense. Gieryn looks at episodes of boundary-work: Was phrenology good science? How about cold fusion? Is social science really scientific? Is organic farming? After centuries of disputes like these, Gieryn finds no stable criteria that absolutely distinguish science from non-science. Science remains a pliable cultural space, flexibly reshaped to claim credibility for some beliefs while denying it to others. In a timely epilogue, Gieryn finds this same controversy at the heart of the raging "science wars."},

  abstract = {Objective: Consumption of traditional and social media markedly increased at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic as new information about the virus and safety guidelines evolved. Much of the information concerned restrictions on daily living activities and the risk posed by the virus. The term doomscrolling is used to describe the phenomenon of elevated negative affect after viewing pandemic-related media. The magnitude and duration of this effect, however, is unclear. Furthermore, the effect of doomscrolling likely varies based on prior vulnerabilities for psychopathology, such as a history of childhood maltreatment. It was hypothesized that social and traditional media exposure were related to an increase in depression and PTSD and that this increase was moderated by childhood maltreatment severity. Method: Participants completed a baseline assessment for psychopathology and 30 days of daily assessments of depression, PTSD, and pandemic-related media use. Results: Using multilevel modeling, social media exposure was associated with increased depression and PTSD. This association was stronger for those with more severe maltreatment histories. Furthermore, those with more severe baseline psychopathology used more social media during this period. These relations were not observed for traditional media sources. Conclusions: These results suggest that regular viewing of pandemic-related social media is associated with increases in psychopathology for those with existing vulnerabilities. Those with such vulnerabilities should adopt strategies to limit social media consumption. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)},
